To perform additional operations when a particular kind of query is executed on
your RONIN database, you can define database triggers.

Database triggers are TypeScript functions that are executed for incoming RONIN
queries, and can be used to validate those queries, run additional queries
within the same transaction, run asynchronous code, or load data from a
different data source.

## Defining Triggers

To get started with locally developing database triggers, provide the `triggers`
option when initizalizing the RONIN TypeScript client, like this:

```ts
import ronin from 'ronin';

const triggers = { ... };
const { get } = ronin({ triggers });
```

In the `triggers` object, you can then define database triggers on a per-model
basis, with the property name being the slug of the model, and the value being
the different triggers you want to define for that model.

For example, if you have a model with the slug `team` and you would like to run
special logic for validating every incoming query for adding records to that
model, you could define an trigger like this one:

```ts
const triggers = {
  team: {
    add: (query) => {
      // Generate a value for the `handle` field
      query.with.handle = query.with.name.toLowerCase();
    
      // Return the query to continue processing
      return query;
    },
  },
};
```

Now, if you were to run the query below, even though you didn't provide a value
for the `handle` field in the query itself, the resulting record would now
contain a value for the field that was generated using the `name` field, thanks
to the trigger you've defined:

```ts
await add.team.with.name('Engineering');
```

## When to use Triggers

In general, you should refrain from using triggers for anything that can be
accomplished using [model definitions](/docs/models), to ensure the best
performance and maintainability of your queries.

For example, if you need to provide any form of static defaults for your
queries (meaning defaults that are the same for every query), you should define
them in the model definition itself, using the `defaultValue` attribute of
fields, for example. Like that, no unnecessary computational step will happen
for your queries.

Even if a value is dynamic, such as a mathematic equation, as long as it does
not depend on the value of another field, and assuming that it always produces
the same output (meaning it is [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system)),
you should still define it in your model definition.

For any use case that is highly dynamic, or that simply cannot be accomplished
using the model definition, you can use database triggers, which perform
computation for every query that is affected.

## Types of Triggers

RONIN supports 2 types of triggers:

- **Synchronous Triggers**: These functions return queries that are executed
  within the same transaction as the original query. Either before the original
  query, after it, or instead of it.
- **Asynchronous Triggers:** These functions are executed separately from the
  database transaction, and can be used to load data from a third-party data
  source, or run asynchronous code.

In the majority of cases, you will want to use Synchronous Triggers, which let
you write arbitrary synchronos code that does not perform any
[I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output) (e.g. no network requests)
and purely validate queries, transform queries, or augment them with additional
surrounding queries.

In certain cases, if you really need to run asynchronous code, you can do so
using Asynchronous Triggers, but in such cases, you should be careful to write
efficient code that, for example, doesn't cause any unnecessary
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) waterfalls.

## Synchronous Triggers

The following methods are available for defining synchronous triggers:

### Before

These triggers provide queries that are executed before the original query is
executed, within the same transaction. They can be used to create additional
resources in the database. For example, if a query depends on a parent record
to get created first, you may create that parent record in a `before*` trigger.

They can return multiple queries and must return at least one query.

```ts
beforeAdd: (query, multiple, options) => {
  return [
    { add: { team: { with: { name: 'Engineering' } } } },
  ];
}
```

#### Methods

- `beforeGet`: Executed before a `get` query.
- `beforeCount`: Executed before a `count` query.
- `beforeAdd`: Executed before an `add` query.
- `beforeSet`: Executed before an `set` query.
- `beforeRemove`: Executed before a `remove` query.

### During

These triggers are executed instead of the original query, within the same
transaction. They can be used to validate the original query, or transform it
by modifying its [query instructions](/docs/queries/instructions).

They must return exactly one query.

```ts
add: (query, multiple, options) => {
  // Modify the query
  return query;
}
```

#### Methods

- `get`: Executed instead of a `get` query.
- `count`: Executed instead of a `count` query.
- `add`: Executed instead of an `add` query.
- `set`: Executed instead of an `set` query.
- `remove`: Executed instead of a `remove` query.

### After

These triggers provide queries that are executed after the original query is
executed, within the same transaction. They can be used to create additional
resources in the database. For example, if a query depends on a child record to
get created after it, you may create that child record in a `after*` trigger.

They can return multiple queries and must return at least one query.

```ts
afterAdd: (query, multiple, options) => {
  return [
    { add: { member: { with: { account: '1234' } } } },
  ];
}
```

#### Methods

- `afterGet`: Executed after a `get` query.
- `afterCount`: Executed after a `count` query.
- `afterAdd`: Executed after an `add` query.
- `afterSet`: Executed after an `set` query.
- `afterRemove`: Executed after a `remove` query.

## Asynchronous Triggers

The following methods are available for defining asynchronous triggers:

### Resolving

These triggers are executed instead of the original query and prevent the
original query from reaching the database. They can therefore be used to load
data from a third-party data source via a network request, and return it from
the trigger.

```ts
resolvingAdd: async (query, multiple, options) => {
  return { testField: 'testValue', anotherField: 'anotherValue' };
}
```

#### Methods

- `resolvingGet`: Executed for a `get` query.
- `resolvingCount`: Executed for a `count` query.
- `resolvingAdd`: Executed for an `add` query.
- `resolvingSet`: Executed for an `set` query.
- `resolvingRemove`: Executed for a `remove` query.

### Following

These triggers are executed after the original query is executed, meaning after
the transaction of the original query was fully committed to the database. They
can be used to run asynchronous code, such as sending a notification to a
third-party service every time a record is added to the database.

```ts
followingAdd: async (query, multiple, before, after, options) => {
  // Run code that should not slow down the original query
}
```

As you can see, the triggers of type `following` are provided two extra function
arguments, which all other types of triggers do not receive: The arguments
`before` and `after` contain the state of the records that were affected by the
original query, before and after the query was executed.

This is useful for generating custom audit logs for your application, for
example, since it allows for diffing the field values of a record.

#### Methods

Unlike the other types of triggers, triggers of type `following` can only be
defined for [qurey types](/docs/queries/types) that write data. They cannot be
defined for query types that read data, such as `get` or `count`.

- `followingAdd`: Executed after an `add` query.
- `followingSet`: Executed after an `set` query.
- `followingRemove`: Executed after a `remove` query.

## Trigger Options

The following options are available for all triggers:

- `query`: An object containing the [instructions](/docs/queries/instructions)
  of the query that is being executed. The argument neither contains the
  [type](/docs/queries/types) of the query, nor the
  [target](/docs/queries/targets) of the query. It only contains the
  instructions of the query. The type and target are already evident from the
  name of the trigger and the model for which it was defined.
- `multiple`: A boolean indicating whether the query targets multiple records
  or a single record. For example, a query such as `get.team()` would result in
  this argument being `false`, while a query such as `get.teams()` would result
  in this argument being `true`.
- `before`: Only available for triggers of type [Following](#Following).
- `after`: Only available for triggers of type [Following](#Following).
- `options`: An object containing a property named `implicit`, which indicates
  whether the query was automatically/implicitly generated by an trigger.
  Additional options are available for [Sink](#Trigger%20Sink) triggers.

## Trigger Sink

<Note>Multiple databases per RONIN space are currently in private beta and not yet publicly available.</Note>

When executing a query, the RONIN TypeScript client allows for providing a
config option named `database`, which can be used to target a specific database
within the RONIN space:

```ts
await add.team.with.name('Engineering', { database: 'my-database' });
```

Queries for which this config option was defined do not cause any triggers to be
executed by default. Instead, such queries must be explicitly captured using
a special trigger named "sink":

```ts
const triggers = {
  sink: {
    get: (query, multiple, options) => {
      // This trigger is executed for queries that target a specific database.
      return query;
    },
  }
};
```

Specifically, as you can see above, sink triggers are using the word "sink" in
place of the model slug. This is because sink triggers capture all queries of
all models.

Additionally, sink queries receive additional properties within the `options`
object that allow for identifying the original query more easily. A `model`
property contains the slug of the model that was targeted, and a `database`
property contains the slug of the database that was targeted.

## Arranging Triggers

While getting started with triggers is as simple as passing the `triggers` option
to the RONIN TypeScript client (as mentioned at the top of this page), it is
strongly recommended to split your triggers out into separate files as soon as
you start writing more than a few lines of code, just like you would with any
other part of your codebase, in order to keep your code clean and easily maintainable.

When doing so, we recommend creating a folder called `triggers` at the root of
your project, and creating a separate file for each model inside of it.

```text
- triggers
-- team.ts
-- member.ts
```

Each file should export the triggers directly, like this:

```ts
export const beforeAdd = () => { ... };
export const add = () => { ... };
export const afterAdd = () => { ... };

export const resolvingAdd = () => { ... };
export const followingAdd = () => { ... };
```

Afterward, create an `index.ts` file inside the `triggers` folder, which imports
all the triggers from the individual files using
[ESM wildcards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import),
so that you can import them all from a single place:

```ts title="index.ts"
import * as team from './triggers/team';
import * as member from './triggers/member';

export { team, member };
```

Lastly, you can import all triggers at once when initializing the RONIN
TypeScript client, like this:

```ts
import ronin from 'ronin';
import * as triggers from './triggers';

const { get } = ronin({ triggers });
```

## Deploying Triggers

Database triggers currently only exist in the same place in which you invoke
the RONIN TypeScript client. This behavior will always be supported, in order
to allow for local development of triggers. In an upcoming update, it will also
become possible to deploy triggers to your RONIN database, for cases in which
you want to access your database from multiple different applications.
