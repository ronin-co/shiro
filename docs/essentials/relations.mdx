While designing an advanced data structure for your application, you will find yourself often wanting to make use of “relations”, which, in RONIN, are only a matter of adding a field of type “Record” to a model, and referencing a different model from it.

The `using` query instruction can then be used to resolve the field when needed.

### Architecture Example

For example, your application might have a model called “Team”, and a model called “Member”, in order to allow for multiple members to be part of a single team.

In order to establish a relation, all you need to do is add a Record field named “Team” to the “Member” model and reference the “Team” model from it. You will then be able to write the ID of a related team as a value for this field.

### Query Example

By default, any query of type `get` whose target model contains a field of type “Record” will not automatically resolve the related record (in favor of performance).

In order to resolve the related record, however, you only need to add the Record field (the relational field) to the `using` instruction, like so:

```ts
// Returns a record where the "team" field is resolved to a related record.
await get.member({
  with: { id: 'acc_vais0g9rrk995tz0' },
  using: ['team'],
});
```

Once you’ve added a field to `using`, the return types of the query will automatically reflect a full record object for that field, instead of only a record ID.

If you're importing a type explicitly, you can pass fields that should be resolved as a generic argument:

```ts
type BlogPostsWithAuthor = BlogPosts<['author']>;
```

You may even pass multiple fields like so:

```ts
BlogPosts<['author', 'category']>;
```

In order to resolve all fields at once, you can pass the string `all` instead of an array of field slugs:

```ts
await get.member({
  with: { id: 'acc_vais0g9rrk995tz0' },
  using: 'all',
});
```

Please note that resolving more fields affects the performance of your query, so you should not use `using: 'all'` unless you really need to resolve all fields. If you only need to resolve some of the fields, define only those fields.
